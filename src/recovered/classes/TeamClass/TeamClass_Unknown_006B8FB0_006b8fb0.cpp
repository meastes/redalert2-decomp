// Red Alert's Remove: takes a foot object out of the team: clears its tag when it is the team's, counts down the task force slot it filled (found by type when slot is -1), unlinks it from the member list, idles it unless arg3, and when no remaining member is initiated (+0x579) flags the first one.
