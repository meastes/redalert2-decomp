// void Matrix3D::Obj_Look_At(Vector3 const &position, Vector3 const &target, float roll) (0x00590F10)
// A transform at position whose Z axis points at target (yaw and pitch from the direction, then roll),
// built from the forward, up and right vectors (Westwood's wwmath Obj_Look_At). The up vector is
// assigned member by member and the length is held as a double (both fix the original's load order).
