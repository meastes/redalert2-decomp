"""Strictly accept hand-written sources, adding new regions or replacing old ones.

Input: a JSON plan listing sources, each with its original entry and the
mangled symbol prefix of the function it defines:

  {"name": "rawfileclass-v1",
   "sources": [{"entry": "006394d0",
                "draft": "build/class-work/RawFileClass/RawFileClass_Is_Open_006394d0.cpp",

                "semantic_name": "RawFileClass_Is_Open_006394d0"}]}

Drafts live outside src/recovered/ (the build refuses uncatalogued sources);
an exact draft is copied to its `source` destination on acceptance. References are bound from manifests/symbols.json
(original names), accepted catalog symbols, address-named symbols, imports
and `// @ref NAME=ADDRESS` comments. The population is frozen against the
frozen inventory bounds (the region's current extent when replacing) and goes
through compile_candidates.py's strict audit. Only exact sources are
installed; a replaced region's old file is removed. A plan may also list
"retire": ["004d0020", ...], accepted regions at other entries that an item
covers entirely (body and frozen padding), e.g. a 3-byte tail region of a function
that the plan accepts whole; see retired_regions. If nothing matches, the
catalog is untouched and the new files are left for further iteration.

Run ./build.command afterwards; it must reproduce the complete file.
